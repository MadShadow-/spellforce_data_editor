# SpellforceDataEditor with viewer
it's all yours!

How to use: Special -> 3D viewer

After running it for thee 1st time, you'll be asked to speecify game directory; choose a directory containing Spellforce.exe. Upon choosing a directory, the viewer preloads all necessary data (it takes a while, so be patient).

Every consecutive use will detect if you specified the directory previously, and will run much faster

# Notes
For now, only Meshes and Animations option works. This will change in the future.
