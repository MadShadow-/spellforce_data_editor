# SpellforceDataEditor with viewer
it's all yours!

How to use: Click Asset Viewer button

After running it for the 1st time, you'll be asked to speecify game directory; choose a directory containing Spellforce.exe. Upon choosing a directory, the viewer preloads all necessary data (it takes a while, so be patient).

Every consecutive use will detect if you specified the directory previously, and will run much faster

To move camera in 3D view, you must click and hold LMB on the 3D view. You can move camera by holding W or S, and you can change camera direction by moving cursor around.

There are 6 viewer modes: Mesh, Animation, Synchronized, Music, Sounds and Messages. First two let you browse all 3D assets by choosing items from the lists on the left of the 3D window. Synchronized works differently: the viewer will show 3D assets assigned to items selected from the main editor. This includes units, items, buildings and environment objects. Finally, Music/Sounds/Messages allow you to listen to any audio found in the game.
