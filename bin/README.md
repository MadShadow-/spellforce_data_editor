# SpellforceDataEditor with viewer
is this branch's name before i added more features, like script builder or mod manager. Now it's more like All-in-one Spellforce Modding Toolbox. It's got many useful features, most of which are described in a [slowly expanding wiki](https://github.com/leszekd25/spellforce_data_editor/wiki). 

To use the application, simply unzip it wherever you feel like.
