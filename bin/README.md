# SpellforceDataEditor with viewer
it's all yours!

How to use: Special -> 3D viewer

After running it for thee 1st time, you'll be asked to speecify game directory; choose a directory containing Spellforce.exe. Upon choosing a directory, the viewer preloads all necessary data (it takes a while, so be patient).

Every consecutive use will detect if you specified the directory previously, and will run much faster

To move camera in 3D view, you must click and hold LMB on the 3D view. You can move camera by holding W or S, and you can change camera direction by moving cursor around.
